# SLIP-Kerala
This repository presents a novel mobile application, named as Slope Instability Predictor-Kerala (SLIP-K), designed to serve as a landslide early warning system (LEWS). The mobile application uses advanced technologies such as geospatial data, real-time monitoring and communication networks to provide accurate and timely information on landslide hazardness to users. The app is connected to a network of sensors and monitoring devices installed in eight locations in the district of Idukki in Kerala, India. It continuously collects rainfall data every 15 minutes in real-time. Using advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, the app processes the collected data to predict potential landslides. Users receive clear and accurate hazard ratings for their specific location. The app provides user-customizable alarm settings depending on location and desire. Users can receive push notifications, to make sure they are immediately aware of any threat that may be present. Real-time information in the form of hazard zones are displayed on an interactive map interface. Users can see landslide-prone locations given by the map. Through the app, users may share information and report observations, helping to create a cooperative early warning system. Through this community involvement, the system's accuracy can be improved, and a sense of shared responsibility is fostered. The LEWS smartphone app SLIP-K aims to close the gap between technical advancement and readiness for disasters. The app improves community engagement and public safety in places at risk of landslides by providing real-time information. It is an essential tool in the fight to lessen the effects of landslides on vulnerable communities, thanks to its user-centric design and extensive capabilities.
